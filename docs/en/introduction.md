# REST API

> `Domain`: `https://api.ubitex.com`

----

# Basic Information

Due to high latency and poor stability, accessing the API through a proxy is not recommended.

For GET requests, parameters should be included in the query params; for POST requests, parameters should be included in the request body.

Set the request header to: `Content-Type=application/json`

For requests other than those starting with `/public`, you need to sign the request payload.

----

# Rate Limiting Rules

Some interfaces have rate limiting (details are specified under each interface). Rate limiting primarily consists of gateway rate limiting and WAF rate limiting.

If an API request triggers gateway rate limiting, it will return `429`, indicating that the access frequency is exceeded and the IP or apiKey may be banned.

Gateway rate limiting is divided into IP rate limiting and apiKey rate limiting.

IP rate limiting example: `100/s/ip`, meaning each IP is limited to a specific number of requests per second for that interface.

apiKey rate limiting example: `50/s/apiKey`, meaning each apiKey is limited to a specific number of requests per second for that interface.

# Signature Explanation

To ensure data security for UBX's open APIs, including protection against data tampering, data expiration, data replay, and access frequency issues, a request signature is required.

1. Apply for `appkey` and `secretkey` through the user center. Different `appkey` and `secretkey` should be used for different calls.

2. Add `timestamp` (the UNIX timestamp in milliseconds of when the request is sent) to the request.

3. Add `signature` (the data signature) to the request.

4. Add `recvwindow` (custom request validity period), which is currently fixed at a certain value.

   > The server will check the timestamp in the request. Requests sent more than 5000 milliseconds ago will be considered invalid. The effective time window can be set using the optional parameter `recvWindow`. If the timestamp is more than 1 second in the future, the request will be rejected. For high-frequency trading, you may adjust the `recvwindow` to meet your timing requirements. It is not recommended to use a `recvwindow` greater than 5 seconds.

5. Add `algorithms` (signature method/algorithm), where the signature is based on hashing. The recommended algorithm is HmacSHA256. Supported algorithms include:
   `HmacMD5, HmacSHA1, HmacSHA224, HmacSHA256 (recommended), HmacSHA384, HmacSHA512`.

## Signature Generation

For example, with `https://api.ubitex.com/v1/spot`:
Here’s how you can use `echo`, `openssl`, and `curl` in a Linux bash environment to call an API for placing an order:

Example `appKey` and `secret`:

- `appKey`: uasdfk-76d0-4f6e-a6b2-asdfdas
- `secretKey`: bc6630d0231fda5cd98794f52c4998659beda290

Header Data:

- `validate-algorithms`: HmacSHA256
- `validate-appkey`: uasdfk-76d0-4f6e-a6b2-asdfdas
- `validate-recvwindow`: 5000
- `validate-timestamp`: 1717234493000
- `validate-signature`: 1231312318f13dc27dbbd02c2cc51ff7059765ed12313131

## Request Data

```json
{"symbol":"BTC_USDT","clientOrderId":"16559590087220001","side":"BUY","type":"LIMIT","timeInForce":"FOK","bizType":"SPOT","price":40000,"quantity":2}
```

### 1. Data Section

- `method`: Request method in uppercase, e.g., GET, POST, DELETE, PUT
- `path`: Concatenate all values in the path in order. For RESTful paths like `/test/{var1}/{var2}/`, concatenate the actual parameters. Example: `/sign/test/bb/aa`
- `query`: Sort all key-value pairs by key in dictionary order and concatenate. Example: `userName=dfdfdf&password=ggg`
- `body`: Directly use the JSON string without conversion or sorting.

    - `x-www-form-urlencoded`: Sort all key-value pairs by key in dictionary order and concatenate. Example: `userName=dfdfdf&password=ggg`
    - `form-data`: This format is not supported.

  If multiple data formats are used, concatenate them in the order of path, query, and body to get the concatenated value.

Method example: POST
Path example: `/v1/spot/order`
Query parameters example: `symbol=btc_usdt`
Body example:
- `x-www-form-urlencoded`:
  ```
  symbol=btc_usdt&side=BUY&type=LIMIT&timeInForce=GTC&quantity=1&price=69000
  ```
- `json`:
  ```json
  {"symbol":"BTC_USDT","clientOrderId":"16559590087220001","side":"BUY","type":"LIMIT","timeInForce":"FOK","bizType":"SPOT","price":40000,"quantity":2,"media":"btok","mediaChannel":"12345"}
  ```

The concatenated value is represented as `Y=#method#path#query#body`.
Note:
- If `query` has data and `body` has no data: `Y=#method#path#query`
- If `query` has no data and `body` has data: `Y=#method#path#body`
- If both `query` and `body` have data: `Y=#method#path#query#body`

### 2. Request Header Section

Concatenate the keys in alphabetical order using `&`, as `X`. Example:

```
validate-algorithms=HmacSHA256&validate-appkey=2fa91add-388c-44f2-8365-f4b72886c135&validate-recvwindow=6000&validate-timestamp=1725455266041
```

### 3. Generate Signature

Combine `X` and `Y` to get `original=XY`. Encrypt this string to get the signature.

```java
String signature=org.apache.commons.codec.digest.HmacUtils.hmacSha256Hex(secretkey, original);
```

Add the generated `signature` to the request header with `validate-signature` as the key.

### 4. Example

- Signature raw message example:

```
validate-algorithms=HmacSHA256&validate-appkey=2fa91add-388c-44f2-8365-f4b72886c135&validate-recvwindow=6000&validate-timestamp=1725455266041#POST#/v1/spot/order#{"symbol":"BTC_USDT","clientOrderId":"16559590087220001","side":"BUY","type":"LIMIT","timeInForce":"FOK","bizType":"SPOT","price":40000,"quantity":2,"media":"btok","mediaChannel":"12345"}
```
- Request example:

```shell
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.ubitex.com/v1/spot/order' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'validate-algorithms: HmacSHA256' \
--header 'validate-appkey: 2fa91add-388c-44f2-8365-f4b72886c135' \
--header 'validate-recvwindow: 6000' \
--header 'validate-timestamp: 1725455266041' \
--header 'validate-signature: ce246607785e168d4677afff5af3746eb8513133d11ca3c5e3913eeea5aca63c' \
--header 'Accept: */*' \
--header 'Host: api.ubitex.com' \
--header 'Connection: keep-alive' \
--data-raw '{"symbol":"BTC_USDT","clientOrderId":"16559590087220001","side":"BUY","type":"LIMIT","timeInForce":"FOK","bizType":"SPOT","price":40000,"quantity":2,"media":"btok","mediaChannel":"12345"}'
```

- Notes:
    - Ensure correct `Content-Type` and parameter formats in the raw signature message and request message.

# FAQs

1. **Why is it that after multiple successful requests, subsequent requests are returned with 500 error codes?**

   This situation might be caused by server instability. We recommend you try sending requests again later. If the problem persists, please contact support.

2. **Why do I encounter an 'Invalid signature' error?**

   This error often results from an incorrect signature. Ensure that the concatenation order and hashing method are accurate. For further assistance, please refer to the documentation for details.

3. **Why am I getting 'Missing request header validate-appkey' error?**

   This means your request is missing the `validate-appkey` header. Please ensure all required headers are included in your request.

4. **Why does the request fail with a 429 status code?**

   A 429 status code indicates that the request rate limit has been exceeded. Please reduce the frequency of your requests.

5. **How can I avoid rate limiting?**

   Adhere to the rate limits specified in the API documentation. Consider using multiple apiKeys if you need to scale up your request volume.

6. **Can I change the signature algorithm?**

   Currently, the supported algorithms are HmacMD5, HmacSHA1, HmacSHA224, HmacSHA256, HmacSHA384, and HmacSHA512. Using HmacSHA256 is recommended.

7. **Why does the request fail with a 'Service unavailable' error?**

   This error indicates that the service is currently unavailable. Please try again later.

8. **What should I do if I encounter a 'Service error' response?**

   This typically indicates an issue on the server side. If the error persists, contact support for further assistance.


9. **AUTH_105: Message Outdated**

    When the server validates the request header parameters `validate-timestamp` (validTimeStamp) and `validate-recvwindow` (recvwindow), the following rules must be met: `dealTimeStamp` (server time when the request is processed, in milliseconds) - `validTimeStamp` < `recvwindow`. If this condition is not satisfied, `AUTH_105` will be returned. To avoid this error, it is recommended to set `validate-timestamp` to the time the request is sent, in milliseconds, and to set `validate-recvwindow` to a larger value.
